I officially received my PhD degree this June—something everyone, including myself, had been expecting. Now, I’ve begun a new chapter as a Postdoctoral Researcher at HKUST. Looking back, this summer has been quite a ride.

### 1. Continuing the PhD Grind

Even after graduation, I didn’t exactly stop working. At the request of my supervisor (and maybe also my own inner drive), I stayed in the lab throughout the summer. Since I had to move out of the student dorms, my supervisor generously provided funding for me to rent a place nearby. That’s where I met two new roommates—one is an MPhil student in CS at the university, the other a doctor from a nearby hospital. Strangely enough, both of them are connected in some way to my research interests. Call it destiny.

Most days I simply woke up, walked into the university as an alumnus, and headed to the lab to wrap up collaboration projects with doctors and companies. My real priority should have been finishing my own research—the slide retrieval work—but I must admit I didn’t manage to complete it as quickly as I hoped. Right now, I’m working diligently at my cubicle to push it forward. But hey, writing a blog in parallel doesn’t hurt. ;)

### 2. Travelling, Travelling, Travelling 


What I didn’t tell many people is that I actually traveled quite a lot this summer—sometimes with my PhD roommates, sometimes with my undergrad friends.

* **May** : I joined my PhD roommates on a short trip to Hong Kong and Macau, mainly as an excuse to activate my HK work visa.
* **June** : I suggested a volcano-visiting trip in Indonesia. Everyone agreed at first, but later one roommate postponed graduation and couldn’t join, while the other thought climbing volcanoes sounded too exhausting. So the plan shifted to Bali and Komodo instead. The trip was nice, but when we got back, I couldn’t help feeling a bit regretful—we had been so close to the volcanoes yet chose to skip them.
* **Late June** : All of us went to Thailand together, this time opting for Chiang Mai and Bangkok instead of more beaches and islands. Chiang Mai was the highlight; Bangkok was fine, though we did run into an Airbnb issue on the first night. Still, the trip gave us a shared memory I’ll always treasure.
* **August** : I finally got my chance to return to Indonesia, this time with my undergrad roommate. We went all-in on the volcano adventure, from Jarkata to Yogyakarta (Mt. Merapi and Mt. Sumbing) to Malang (Mt. semeru) to Banyuwangi (Mt. Ijen) to Surabaya (Mt. Komodo). And yes—it was every bit as exhausting as my PhD roommates had warned, but the landscapes were breathtaking. I also met fellow travelers from all over the world, including a PhD student from Italy and even someone who had reviously worked in my hometown. It’s incredible how you can meet such people in completely unexpected places, all just living their lives in their own way.

### 3. Settling Into Hong Kong Life

I also had an unforgettable experience during my final days in Hangzhou, but that's not for today's blog. By late August, I officially moved to Hong Kong to start my postdoc. Thanks to my visiting experience here in 2023, settling in this time was smooth. I met some friends in Shenzhen to pick out decorations, ordered plenty of things online, and slowly made my place feel like home. Luck was on my side again—my landlord never bothered to clean up the other two rooms, which means I get the whole apartment to myself.

As for work, so far it feels like the perfect fit. The group is growing quickly, and in recent meetings I’ve seen so many talented young people joining. Honestly, it’s a bit intimidating at times, but also inspiring. I’m pushing myself to meet the expectations of this position, and I hope things will continue to go well. Wish me luck!
